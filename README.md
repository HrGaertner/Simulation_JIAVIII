# Simulation_JIAVIII
Developing the simulation for the JIAVIII Project at the [HHG](https://hhg-kl.de)

The project has finished now but we are eager to realize this project. Just contact us e.g. in a issue!


## Tools we used

The Dataformat is defined by [GeoJSON](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON)

because we are using [leaflet-realtime](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime)

This [document](https://github.com/movsim/traffic-simulation-de/blob/master/doc/TrafficSimulationDe.pdf) helps as simulating the cars

## We have a new release! It is called "Hearts on fire" named after the song of passenger
